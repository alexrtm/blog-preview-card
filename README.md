## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
The main thing I learned in this project was responsive typography using clamp(). This allowed me to add responsive typography without the need for excessive media queries. 

### Continued development

-Dive deeper into CSS Grid and Flexbox to create complex, responsive layouts. Practice building multi-column layouts, complex grids, and alignments.
-CSS Animations: Explore CSS animations and transitions to add subtle effects to web pages. In particular use animations for loading states, hover effects, and modal transitions.
-Responsive Design: Explore responsive design patterns, like fluid grids, adaptive typography, and responsive images (`picture` element, srcset).
-Accessibility: Deepen understanding of web accessibility (a11y). Learn about ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes and how to implement accessible forms, navigation, and media.
